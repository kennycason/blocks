blocks
======

This was one of the first games I ever wrote to completion. So I'm uploading the source just for the sake of nastalgia :)

Blocks is a tetris like game written in Purebasic. Blocks features 3 modes:

Baby Mode – simple pieces constructed from 3 bricks.

Normal Mode – standard tetris pieces.

Blocks Mode – pieces constructed from 1 – 6 bricks. 27 different pieces, including a randomly generated piece that can take on bizzare shapes. In this mode it is possible to clear 6 lines at once, earning yourself a “Block.” I recommend playing it in block mode and large size for the most fun. :) Enjoy!
High Scores are saved for each of the modes.
